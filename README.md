# RL Based Inverted Pendulum over Wireless Channel 
### Wired + Wireless Implementation

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements control of an inverted pendulum system using both **wired** (Arduino-based) and **wireless** (ESP-NOW-based) architectures.

The system is modeled and analyzed in **MATLAB/Simulink**, and control is implemented using a **proportional controller** derived via pole placement techniques.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 1. Wired Control (Arduino)
- Sensor readings are directly obtained by the Arduino
- Control computation is performed locally
- Output voltage is applied directly to the motor

### 2. Wireless Control (ESP32 + Arduino)
- Sensor data is collected by an ESP32 (plant side)
- Data is transmitted via **ESP-NOW**
- Controller ESP32 computes control input
- Control signal is sent back to plant ESP
- Arduino Mega acts as a voltage interface (**3.3V → 5V**) for motor actuation
